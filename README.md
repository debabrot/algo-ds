## Tree learning path

9. Recommended Practice Order
Before LeetCode, practice these manually or in Python:

Implement all 3 DFS traversals (recursive)
Implement BFS (level-order)
Find max depth of tree
Count total nodes
Search in BST
Check if a tree is balanced (conceptually)
Find min/max in BST
Print all root-to-leaf paths
âœ… 10. Beginner-Friendly LeetCode Problems (Once Ready)
When you're comfortable, try these (in order):

104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
226. Invert Binary Tree
100. Same Tree
101. Symmetric Tree
112. Path Sum
94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
ðŸ’¡ Tip: Solve each one recursively first, then try iterative if you want. 

ðŸ“Œ Final Checklist Before LeetCode
âœ… Understand tree vocabulary
âœ… Can build a tree in code
âœ… Know DFS (pre/in/post) and BFS
âœ… Comfortable with recursion on trees
âœ… Can trace traversals by hand
âœ… Solved 3â€“5 basic problems on your own


1. Tree Terminology
Root, parent, child, leaf, subtree, depth, height, level
Binary Tree vs Binary Search Tree (BST)
Full, Complete, Perfect, Balanced trees (know the difference)
2. Tree Traversals (Must Know!)
Youâ€™ve done BFS/DFS â€” now go deeper:

DFS Traversals (Recursive & Iterative):
Pre-order (Root â†’ Left â†’ Right)
In-order (Left â†’ Root â†’ Right) â†’ especially important for BSTs
Post-order (Left â†’ Right â†’ Root)
BFS (Level-order traversal) using a queue
Practice writing all traversals iteratively and recursively.
3. Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
Properties: left < root < right
Search, Insert, Delete operations
Validate if a tree is a valid BST
Find Minimum/Maximum in a BST
Find Successor/Predecessor
4. Basic Problem Patterns
These are common in easy/medium LeetCode problems:

Find min/max depth
Check if two trees are the same
Invert a binary tree
Check if a tree is symmetric (mirror of itself)
Path sum problems (e.g., "Does a root-to-leaf path sum to X?")
Count number of nodes or leaves
Diameter of a tree (slightly advanced but common)
5. Tree Construction Basics
Build a tree from array (level-order input, like LeetCode uses)
Construct BST from sorted array (e.g., "Convert Sorted Array to BST")
Reconstruct tree from traversals (e.g., In-order + Pre-order â†’ Tree)
6. Recursive Thinking
Most tree problems use recursion.
Understand base cases (null node), recursive cases, and how to combine results.
Learn to think: "What do I do at current node? What do I ask my children?"
7. Using Helper Functions & Passing Data
Sometimes you need to pass extra parameters (e.g., current path, depth, target).
Use helper functions in recursion or maintain state with lists.
